Welcome to Toy Exchange, a platform for parents to list toys they no longer need and find toys they want in their local community at no cost.
- _Toy Exchange_ is a website for parents who want to spend less on toys.
- Users can create an account, list the toys they no longer want and search for toys by category, brand, zip-code and age-group.
- When they find a toy they like, they can communicate with the Toy Exchanger and arrange for a pick-up.
- Check out the live site at [link](www.toyexchange.herokuapp.com)
